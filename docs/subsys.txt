
 The subsystems.

---

- The main subsystem for the operating system will be called the **Gramado Subsystem**.  
- The main display server for the Gramado Subsystem is called **ds00/** and 
is located in the **windows/** folder.  

We might add some other subsystems in the future, but all other subsystems 
will depend on the Gramado Subsystem. For example, a **Posix Subsystem** will need 
to call the Gramado Subsystem to access resources. This design ensures that 
only the main subsystem interacts directly with kernel resources.  

However, some exceptions may exist. For instance, certain subsystems, 
like the **network server**, could call the kernel directly when necessary.  

At the moment, all applications are allowed to call the kernel directly.

### Main Objective:
All inputs must first be routed to the main subsystem (Gramado Subsystem), 
which will act as a **proxy** for the other subsystems.
