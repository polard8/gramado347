
 The client-side application getting input via stdin.
 ex: terminal.

 The client-side application with an overlapped window
needs to receive input via stdin and send a request to the 
display server, telling to the server to print the input char
into the window with focus.

 We need to create a request to send chars ... 
 maybe we already have something useful.
